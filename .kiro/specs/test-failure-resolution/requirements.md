# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for resolving test failures in the online shopping platform's Playwright end-to-end test suite. The goal is to identify, fix, and optimize the most critical test failures to ensure reliable automated testing with a focused set of 20 essential tests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix critical test failures, so that I can ensure the application's core functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test failures THEN the system SHALL identify the root causes of test failures
2. WHEN fixing test issues THEN the system SHALL prioritize core functionality tests over edge cases
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 90% pass rate on critical functionality
4. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and debugging information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the test suite to focus on essential functionality, so that I can reduce test execution time and maintenance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting tests THEN the system SHALL include only the 20 most critical test scenarios
2. WHEN running the optimized test suite THEN the system SHALL complete execution in under 10 minutes
3. WHEN tests are selected THEN the system SHALL cover all major user workflows
4. WHEN maintaining tests THEN the system SHALL use reliable selectors and stable test patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix test infrastructure issues, so that tests run consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL handle timing issues with proper waits and assertions
2. WHEN elements are not found THEN the system SHALL provide fallback strategies or better selectors
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle network delays and errors gracefully
4. WHEN tests interact with UI THEN the system SHALL wait for elements to be ready before interaction

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure test data consistency, so that tests don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL use isolated test data for each test
2. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up test data to prevent interference
3. WHEN multiple tests run THEN the system SHALL ensure proper test isolation
4. WHEN test data is needed THEN the system SHALL provide reliable test fixtures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to publish test results in a clear format, so that I can easily understand test outcomes and failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive test report
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and error details
3. WHEN publishing results THEN the system SHALL provide both summary and detailed views
4. WHEN analyzing results THEN the system SHALL highlight critical failures vs minor issues
